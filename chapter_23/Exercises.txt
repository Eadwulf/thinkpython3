23.9. Exercises¶

    1) Add a method, print_hands, to the OldMaidGame class which traverses self.hands and prints each hand.

    2) Define a new kind of Turtle, TurtleGTX, that comes with some extra features: it can jump forward a
       given distance, and it has an odometer that keeps track of how far the turtle has travelled since it
       came off the production line. (The parent class has a number of synonyms like fd, forward, back,
       backward, and bk: for this exercise, just focus on putting this functionality into the forward method.)
       Think carefully about how to count the distance if the turtle is asked to move forward by a negative
       amount. (We would not want to buy a second-hand turtle whose odometer reading was faked because its
       previous owner drove it backwards around the block too often. Try this in a car near you, and see if
       the car’s odometer counts up or down when you reverse.)

    3) After travelling some random distance, your turtle should break down with a flat tyre. After this
       happens, raise an exception whenever forward is called. Also provide a change_tyre method that can
       fix the flat.
