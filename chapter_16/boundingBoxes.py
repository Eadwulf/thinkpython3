"""
In games, we often put a rectangular “bounding box” around 
our sprites. (A sprite is an object that can move about in
the game, as we will see shortly.) We can then do collision
detection between, say, bombs and spaceships, by comparing 
whether their rectangles overlap anywhere.

Write a function to determine whether two rectangles 
collide. Hint: this might be quite a tough exercise!
Think carefully about all the cases before you code.
